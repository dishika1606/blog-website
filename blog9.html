                    <p>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.in/All-Bright-Places-Jennifer-Niven/dp/0385755910" target="_blank">
                    All the Bright Places</a> is hands down one of the most perplexing yet hard-hitting novels I've ever read. 
                    The book takes us through the lives of <a href="https://all-the-bright-places.fandom.com/wiki/Theodore_Finch" 
                    target="_blank">Theodore Finch</a>, a young boy who struggles with multiple mental health disorders and 
                    <a href="https://all-the-bright-places.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Markey" target="_blank">Violet Markey</a>, a 
                    formerly popular girl who put herself through social exile after her sister, Eleanor's death. After a fateful 
                    encounter at the school bell tower where Finch saves Violet from jumping off, their lives entangle in a dance 
                    of keeping each other afloat and saving each other from getting sucked into the vortex of trauma, loss, guilt 
                    and depression.</p>
                    <h2>Denial and Acceptance</h2>
                    <div>As the story takes course, the two characters: Violet and Finch get paired up for a Geography project on 
                    exploring Indiana. The project reforms into something more for both of them. Violet deals with the troubles of 
                    accepting the fact that her sister's death was not her fault and that she has the right to move on with her life 
                    despite the inexplicable amount of grief she's going through, by finally opening up and talking about it to Finch. 
                    Similarly, Finch unclamps about his physical abuse at the hands of his father and his mother's state of denial 
                    about his steeply deteriorating mental heath due to depression and undiagnosed bipolar disorder.&nbsp;</div>
                    <blockquote><div>"Sometimes, Ultraviolet, things feel true to us even if they're not."</div></blockquote>
                    <h2>Holding on and Letting Go</h2>
                    <p>Finch doesn't prefer labels and likes to dwell in smaller spaces as they bring him a sense of security and 
                    familiarity. And isn't that what we all crave in a way? It made me ponder about the purpose of associating 
                    ourselves in smaller groups, making ourselves vulnerable only to selective people. Even the idea of letting 
                    ourselves be expressive of our intimate thoughts knowingly or unknowingly, puts us in a state of intermittent 
                    panic, but that's not the case with 'our' people. And Violet answers to the definition of 'our' people to 
                    perfection:</p>
                    <blockquote><p>"I guess you can be yourself, whatever that means- the best and the worst of you. And they love 
                    you anyway. You can fight, but even when you're mad at them, you know they're not going to stop being your 
                    friend."</p></blockquote>
                    <div>Violet is that person to Finch. She pulls him our of the twisted, gloomy ideas of dying that his mind 
                    compels him to think and helps him 'Stay Awake' and not 'Sleep'. Violet is like his life support and he holds 
                    onto her tightly.&nbsp;</div>
                    <div>For Violet, being with Finch guides her through the path of self- absolution and recovery. 
                    She learns that:</div>
                    <blockquote><div>"Growth itself contains the germ of happiness. Maybe a germ is enough. Maybe it's all you 
                    need."</div></blockquote>
                    <h2>Life and Death</h2><div>The book revolves around the these two conflicting yet complementary phenomenal 
                    happenings. Finch is a controversy in himself, an oxymoron personified: a complex character obsessed with the 
                    idea of dying while desiring to visually experience a map of beautiful and undiscovered places in life. When 
                    Violet asks him why ambushed her into doing the Indiana project with him he simply replied:</div>
                    <blockquote><p>"<b>Because our mountain is waiting.</b>...I think I've got a map in my car that wants to be used, 
                    and I think there are places we can go that need to be seen. Maybe no one will ever visit them and appreciate 
                    them or take time to think they're important, but maybe even the smallest place can mean something to us. At 
                    least by the time we leave, we know we've seen it, this great state of ours. So come on. Let's go. Let's count 
                    for something. <b>Let's get off that ledge.</b>"&nbsp;</p>
                    </blockquote><p>&nbsp;Finch and Violet are very conflicting in a way, the former romanticizes death whereas the 
                    latter is terrified at the idea of oblivion, dearth and paucity it brings with it. But by the end of the book, 
                    it all culminates to just one thought:</p>
                    <blockquote><p>"We do not remember days, we remember moments."</p></blockquote>
                    <div class="center"><img data-original-height="1799" data-original-width="1171" height="320" src="images/blog9.1.jpg">
                    </div><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;What are some small things/ moments that make life worth living? Let me know in the comments and let's 
                    make this small space a reminiscence of all things radiant and blissful. Thanks you for reading and see you back 
                    next week!&nbsp;</p>
