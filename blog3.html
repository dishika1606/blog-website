                    <blockquote>
                        <div>"To be clear, there are things I regret. It's just...it's not really sordid things. 
                        I don't regret many of the lies I told or the people I hurt. I'm OK with the fact that sometimes 
                        doing the right thing gets ugly. And also, I have compassion for myself. I trust myself."

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>&nbsp;Sometimes, you need to be brutally honest to people you care about, when their actions are causing 
                    you mental, emotional or physical harm. Sometimes, they may not deserve it but never regret something when 
                    you've had your reasons and did the best you could with every thought and feeling that led up to it. It is 
                    also essential to note that there is a significant difference between being <i>apologetic</i> and <i>regretful.

                    <blockquote>
                        <div>"Some marriages aren't really that great. Some loves aren't all-encompassing. Sometimes you separate 
                        because you weren't good together to begin with. Sometimes divorce isn't an earth-shattering loss. Sometimes 
                        it's just two people waking up out of a fog."

                    <p>&nbsp;<b>Love is all about the rhythmic harmony of holding on and letting go</b>. Knowing and accepting when 
                    something doesn't feel right or isn't enough despite all the efforts. Love can be something very complex and messy
                    and yet very simple at the same time, but one thing that it should never be is difficult. Know when to fight for 
                    it and when to walk away from it.</p>
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>"I wasn't heartbroken when Don left me. I simply felt my marriage had failed. And those are two very

                        <p>The major characters in this trenchant story go to great lengths to conceal their true identity because of 
                        how unaccepting the world could be and how infelicitous and unrewarding it would be according the their chosen 
                        careers. They lose precious bonds due to this society induced obscurity over and over again. But we have the
