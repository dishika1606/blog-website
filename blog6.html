                    Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;is an intricate journey of two 
                    Mexican-American boys- Aristotle and Dante in the peak age of fifteen, trying to find authenticity in a world 
                    where everything is predefined and yet so much is unknown.&nbsp;</div>
                    <blockquote><div><i>"Sometimes I thought that being fifteen was the worst tragedy of all."&nbsp;</i></div></blockquote>
                    <p><a href="https://aristotleanddante.fandom.com/wiki/Aristotle_Mendoza" target="_blank">Aristotle "Ari" Mendoza</a> 
                    constantly felt like his life was someone else's idea, like he was just a passenger in the ride of his life. He was 
                    the kind of boy who liked not being seen, until he met <a href="https://aristotleanddante.fandom.com/wiki/Dante_
                    Quintana" target="_blank">Dante Quintana</a> at the swimming pool one summer. It was the kind of friendship where 
                    they instantly clicked, like the magnetic attraction of polar opposites.</p>
                    <p>Their meets get more frequent and Ari is astounded by the genuine sincerity of Dante and his uncharacteristic 
                    outlook on life. He didn't say things to be funny, he was just being himself. Dante taught him language of literature 
                    and art and his passionate desire to unearth the secrets of the universe and change the world with their possession. 
                    Dante was another mystery of the universe that Ari tried to uncover.</p>
                    <blockquote><p><i>"I don't understand how you could live in a mean world and not have any of the meanness rub off 
                    on you. How could a guy live without meanness?"</i></p></blockquote>
                    <p>Dante had supportive and communicative parents, whereas Ari's- not so much. His mother kept the reason for his 
                    brother's imprisonment a secret from Ari whereas his father suffered from PTSD even before Ari was born. He felt truly 
                    suffocated and isolated in his own home but growing closer to the Dante's family made him realize what he was 
                    missing.&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote><p><i>"I'm crazy about my mom and dad." That really made me smile. I'd never heard anyone say that about 
                    their parents. Except Dante.</i></p></blockquote>
                    <p>Ari is repulsed by the idea of liking a boy. While Dante confesses his love for Ari, Ari prefers to dismiss his 
                    behind the veil of friendship. He's terrified of accepting his identity because his aunt was exiled from his family 
                    for being a lesbian and she died alone with only Ari and his parents in attendance at her funeral.&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote><p><i>"The summer sun wasn't meant for boys like me. Boys like me belong to the rain."&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img alt="Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the universe quote theme"  src="images/blog6.jpg" 
                        title="Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the universe quote" >
                    </div>
                    <p>After Dante comes back from Chicago, he gets brutally roughed up by a bunch of local boys for kissing his 
                    boyfriend Daniel. The idea of people judging him so harshly based on his sexual orientation is enraging for Ari,
                    who doesn't realize his own hypocrisy in it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote><p><i>"Maybe everyone loves differently. Maybe that's all that matters."</i></p></blockquote>
                    <p>Ari had time and again shown his love for Dante through subtle acts but it took a long conflict with himself 
                    to finally come to terms with his identity. To understand that it is okay to be fifteen and not always to the 
                    right thing, just do the best one can at the moment. To know that we all fight our own private wars. To know that 
                    family can be a complex thing and with a prolonged minute efforts and effective communication, every fissure in 
                    these relationships can be healed. All it takes is mutual understanding and the willingness to take a step towards 
                    resolution.&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote><p><i>"Maybe we just lived between hurting and healing."</i></p></blockquote>
