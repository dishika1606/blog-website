                        character could've done something so gruesome after the grand reveal of the big 'who'.</li>
                        <li><b style="background-color: #ffd1cc;">Anger:</b> This feeling is mostly directed towards the 
                        antagonist for all the pain they've caused to the other characters because you've come to love their 
                        flawed yet repentant selves.</li>
                        <li><b style="background-color: #ffd1cc;">Bargaining:</b> Scrutinizing the reasons that drove the culprit 
                        to take such adverse measures and apprehending his morality and conscience</li>
                        <li><span style="background-color: #ffd1cc;"><b>&nbsp;Depression:</b></span> The most unsparing stage of 
                        all symptoms of which include feeling aloof and detached, like a huge void in your heart that cannot be 
                        filled coupled with getting brutally smacked&nbsp;by the fact that you cannot unknow the book and read it 
                        for the first time ever again. (*sobs internally*)</li>
                        <li><span style="background-color: #ffd1cc;"><b>Acceptance:</b></span> Feeling a sense of satisfaction and 
                        triumph on having checked yet another remarkable fic-lit from your TBR (to be read) list and moving on to a

                    <p>Anyway coming back to our story,it majorly revolves around the lives of five students of Bayview High:</p>

                             The outcast wannabe who runs a scandalous gossip app called 'About That'.</p>
                    <p>When all of them end up in detention one day under suspicious circumstances, Simon is killed. Followed by 
                    Tumblr posts which make the other four students the prime suspects.</p>
                    <blockquote><i>"Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them."</i></blockquote>
                    <h2>The Glorified Virtuality:</h2>
                    <p>All that glitters...</p>
                    <p>All of these characters have a seemingly lucid image. But underneath the false charade, each of them conceals 
                    deep, unspoken secrets or battles that they fight alone. This create a delusion to the outsiders who fall for the 
                    seeming perfection and when the truth is out, it leaves then flabbergasted. The secret keepers feel exposed and 
                    vulnerable as the destructive tides of social media wreck everything they protected and concealed.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Everyone has their flaws and imperfection but we fail to realize that due to the blinding glitz and glams of the 
                    virtual world. One shouldn't succumb to the deception of appearances and not lose control.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><b>Remember, you control these apps, not the other way round. Curate your feed such that it inspires you to be a 
                    better person, not make you look down on yourself.</b> (Yes, there is a significant difference between the two.)</p>
                    <h2>The Good 'Ol Feminism Issue:</h2>
                    <blockquote><p><i>"Sexism is alive and well in true crime coverage, because Bronwyn and I aren't nearly as popular 
                    with the general public as Cooper and Nate. Especially Nate. They couldn't care less that he is a convicted drug 
                    dealer, because he's got dreamy eyes. Bronwyn and I are pariahs- other than her friends, her sister and Janae, 
                    hardly anyone talks to us."</i></p></blockquote>
                    <p>In the words of Taylor Swift- "A man does something, it's 'strategic'; a woman does the same thing, it's '
                    ​calculated.' A man is allowed to 'react'; a woman can only 'overreact."</p>
                    <p>This book subtly shows how the media and the world in general perceives&nbsp;accused women. It is always the 
                    women who need to be extra careful and precautious and yet the first ones to be deemed erroneous. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Addy has been so dominated by her boyfriend during the course of her relationship that she finds it difficult 
                    to identify her own interests and preferences. In a way, the liberation from her boyfriend shows her the truth 
                    about her 'friends' and gives her the independence she deserves in making her own life choices.</p>
                    <h2>The Social Strata and Groupism:</h2>
                    <p>Everyone of the five characters struggles to fit in in one way or another. Addy finds it difficult to have a 
                    new life and start alone after her jock friends abandon her after her breakup. Nate has always been labelled as 
                    the financially struggling guy abandoned by his mother and living with his addict father, who resorts to selling 
                    drugs to make ends meet. Cooper is the jock who is dissatisfied even though he's positioned among the elite. 
                    Bronwyn is the untouchable, straight A's, goal-oriented girl who is unambitious to climb the social ladder 
                    unlike Simon.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Simon is the outsider, the invader of the elitists when his former jock best friend starts to cut ties 
                    with him. He is deeply disturbed by the shifting attention which drives him to seek it in nefarious ways like the 
                    gossip app. He felt abandoned and struggled with depression due to this social pyramid. Even after his death, 
                    he was remembered as the 'castaway'.</p>
                    <p>Groupism is a very common problem that has to be tackled by everyone at least once at some point in their 
                    lives. <b>Being more communicative, accepting and acknowledging the people who are there with you rather than 
                    fixating on people who aren't are the different ways of dealing with it.</b></p>
                    <p>This is a must read for everyone, especially teenagers as it highlights very relatable, coming-of-age 
                    problems. What are some other problems that Gen-Z teens have to deal with. Do let me know in the comments.</p>
                    <p>Hope you liked today's post. Stay tuned for the next one!</p>
