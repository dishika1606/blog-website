                     accept the uniqueness of one's mind, body and soul despite it all.</h2>

                    </div>
                    <h3>So who is <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Darius-Great-Okay-Adib-Khorram/dp/0525552960">Darius the Great</a> 
                    and why is he not okay?&nbsp;</h3>
                    <div>Darius is just an American-Persian boy living his life in the shadows, avoiding the attention of 'Soulless 
                    Minions of Orthodoxy' who make fun of his name and heritage. Being meek and shy, he tries to let it go instead of 
                    standing up to them, which makes his disapproving father, an 'Ubermensch'; dissatisfied and unhappy with him. 
                    Clinically depressed and disoriented, Darius feels like a social outcast who doesn't belong anywhere and might 
                    never be enough no matter what he does.</div>
                    <blockquote><i>"It's okay to not be okay."</i>></blockquote>
                    <h4>The Transitional Journey from Darius to Darioush -</h4>
                    <p>When his grandfather is diagnosed with a terminal illness, Darius and his family get to visit his native 
                    country and meet his maternal relatives for the first time in his life. Dealing with his grandfather's cutting 
                    remarks, the gruesome comments of some local boys and taunts of his uncle based on his physical appearance, 
                    Darius feels like he doesn't belong.</p>
                    <h3>A Heart-Warming Companionship-</h3>
                    <p>Through all of it, Darius has a companion- Sohrab: a local Iranian boy and an amicable neighbor who accepts 
                    Darius for who he is, defends him from bullies and their hurtful judgments and makes him feel like he belongs 
                    by urging people to speak in English around Darius as he is hardly versed in Farsi. The building of their new 
                    found friendship is like sipping on a warm, welcoming cup of tea for the soul: refreshing, comforting and 
                    inexplicably beautiful.</p>
                    <blockquote><i>"Everyone wants you here. We have a saying in Farsi. It translates 'your place was empty'. We say 
                    it when we miss somebody."</i></blockquote>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img alt="Daruis the great is not okay indivuation biracial self acceptance" src="images/blog5.1.jpg" 
                        title="Embracing Biracialism and Multi-Ethnicity"></div>
                    <h4>The Fragile Familial Dynamic-</h4>
                    <p>Darius is constantly riddled with the fear of being replaced by his younger sister, Laleh who he feels is 
                    like a do-over for his parents; a perfect little girl fluent in Farsi, charming, popular and socially accepted 
                    everywhere she goes: the polar opposite of him. He gets jealous at times but his insecurity never leads him to 
                    be hateful and despise his loving sister. The only person who loves him for who he is other than Sohrab is his 
                    Mamou, who never fails to show her affection for her beloved grandson even though she doesn't completely 
                    understand him at all times. He always seeks the validation of his father and it is soul crushing to see how 
                    much it affects him when he doesn't get it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>Dealing with Depression-&nbsp;</h4>
                    <p>Darius always felt like people thought the worst about him. He was his own critic. He'd push people away and 
                    feel like he was being selfish when he put himself before others. He had a seemingly good life but what people 
                    failed to understand was that <b>depression doesn't necessarily need a reason</b>. It just is, an as Darius 
                    states <i>'his brain simply doesn't produce the right chemicals'</i>. The pellets of harrowing memories go 
                    unnoticed until they hail a devastating and adverse snowstorm of physical and emotional affliction.</p>
                    <p>It's so heart rendering to watch everyone eventually trying to find a way to connect to that side of Darius 
                    and his emotional 'Slingshot Maneuvers' (or as we call them- mood swings) if not make it better, in their own 
                    adorable ways.</p>
                    <blockquote><i>"Suicide isn't the only way you can lose someone to depression."</i></blockquote>
                    <p>In the book, Darius' mother also acknowledges the <b>difficulties of moving away</b>. It requires abundant 
                    sacrifice and the willingness to start over; no matter how challenging it gets. But at the same time, it is 
                    important to bear a part of your inheritance with pride.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The beautiful story of Darioush teaches us to treasure, love and <b>cherish your family</b>, value their
                    sacrifices and be there for them unwaveringly, despite trivial complexities and differences. It never gets 
                    easy to conquer the generation gap between you and your parents, sometimes even your siblings. But they are 
                    always wishing the best for you, however difficult it may seem to believe. <b>Communicate, express and involve 
                    them in your life</b>, trust me they love that. ;)</p>
                    <p>What is your take on approaching and helping people with depression, as a therapist or a confidant? I would 
                    love to hear from you in the comments!</p>
                    <p>Thank you folks, the next post rolls out next week so stay tuned :-)</p>
