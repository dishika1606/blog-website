                    like he was made of fragile glass. They show us how important it is to keep your calm even in the most adverse situations

                        <p>They showed immense professionalism: they were divided into two social groups but never failed to play as
                        one on court. There were moments in the books where I was fueled by their tournament matches: the fiery 
                        passion, dedication and mesmerizing coordination they shared on court. The conflicting emotions and 
                        choices, the bitter-sweet feeling and the wholesomeness that these books leave you with is incomparable.
